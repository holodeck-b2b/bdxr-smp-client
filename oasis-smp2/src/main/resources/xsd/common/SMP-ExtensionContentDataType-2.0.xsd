            Any element in any namespace other than the UBL extension
            namespace is allowed to be the apex element of an extension.
            Only those elements found in the UBL schemas and in the
            trees of schemas imported in this module are validated.
            Any element for which there is no schema declaration in any
            of the trees of schemas passes validation and is not
            treated as a schema constraint violation.
